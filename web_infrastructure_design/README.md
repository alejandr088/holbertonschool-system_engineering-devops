# Web infrastructure design

In this project we have to make different designs for Web Infrastructure, from simple web stacks to more secured, monitored and high scaled infrastructures.

To do so we can draw on whiteboard or use the software we prefer, so i choose Lucid schemes, we must take a photo and upload to any image hosting. (imgur in this case)

Here are the links for the images of the tasks:
